# Algorithms and Data Structures

Repository to study and practice data structures and algorithms implemented in JavaScript. Contains exercises and solutions organized by platform and topic.

## Overview

- Language: JavaScript (Node.js)
- Purpose: collection of exercises, examples and solutions for practice and learning.
- Usage: run files with `node` to test small solutions.

## Repository structure

- `algorithms/`
  - `codesignal/` — CodeSignal exercises (e.g., `add.js`, `shapeArea.js`)
  - `daily_coding_problem/` — Daily Coding Problem (e.g., `daily_coding_01.js`)
  - `hackerrank/` — HackerRank exercises (e.g., `fizzbuzz.js`)
  - `project_euler/` — Project Euler problems (e.g., `fibonacci.js`)
- `datastructures/` — space to implement data structures
- `README.md` — this file

## Status by source

| Source          | Level | Status       |
| --------------- | ----- | ------------ |
| `codesignal`    | Basic | Paused       |
| `daily_coding`  | Basic | Paused       |
| `hackerrank`    | Basic | In progress  |
| `project_euler` | Basic | In progress  |

## How to run examples

In the terminal (Node.js installed):

- Run a specific file:
  - Windows / WSL:
    - `node algorithms/project_euler/fibonacci.js`
    - `node algorithms/codesignal/adjacentElementsProduct.js`

Files are simple scripts; adjust as needed to test functions.

## Best practices

- Add unit tests for functions as examples evolve.
- Keep each exercise in a separate, clearly named file.
- Document complex solutions with comments and complexity analysis.
